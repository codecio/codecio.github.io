Ran into an issue where the custom domain was being overwritten due to the publish directory generated from Hugo not containing the CNAME file.
To restore the site I had to drill into the pages settings again and set the domain and check enforce https. In order to fix it for future deployments, I&amp;rsquo;ve added the finnp/create-file-action@master action to create the CNAME file on each deployment.</description></item><item><title>My First Post</title><link>https://colecio.com/posts/2021/08/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 23:36:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://colecio.com/posts/2021/08/my-first-post/</guid><description>In a moment of madness I decided to buy a domain name.
Beyond using it for the AWS lab account for various DNS services, I decided to also use it for the www subdomain and Apex domain. A couple weeks later reading an article about static site generators, I found myself deciding between Antora or Hugo. Hugo seemed like the more light-weight choice to deploy and maintain. Created a src repo that uses github actions to publish to the repo connected to my github pages automagically.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://colecio.com/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://colecio.com/about/</guid><description>Hugo is the worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites.
